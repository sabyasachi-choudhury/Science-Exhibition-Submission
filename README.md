This repo contains my code for a national science exhibition. Our team decided to go with how AI would affect the future, and I built 2 models to showcase this.

The first was an RNN which could predict machine failure times, something which could be very useful in factories
The second was a DNN which could predict agricultural inputs needed, and where they would be best used
Finally, I also trained the yolov5 model architecture to distinguish between good and bad produce.

While we didn't win the exhibition, the experience was definitely educational and very fun.
